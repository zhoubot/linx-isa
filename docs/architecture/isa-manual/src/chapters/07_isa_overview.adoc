[[isa-overview]]
== Instruction set overview

This chapter provides a narrative overview of the major instruction families in the v0.2 catalog. The complete,
generated listing is in <<insnref>>.

[[isa-overview-scalar]]
=== Scalar core (32-bit base)

The scalar core includes:

* Integer arithmetic and logic (register and immediate forms)
* Compare and condition setting (`CMP.*`, `SETC.*`)
* Explicit block transitions (`BSTART.*`, `BSTOP`)
* Loads/stores with multiple addressing modes (register offset, immediate offset, PC-relative, pre/post-index, pair)

Many scalar instructions support writing results to:

* an architectural destination register (`->a0`, `->s1`, …), and/or
* a ClockHands queue (`->t`, `->u`)

[[isa-overview-compressed]]
=== Compressed forms (16-bit `C.*`)

Compressed forms provide common short encodings:

* Block markers (`C.BSTART.*`, `C.BSTOP`)
* Simple ALU and move operations (`C.ADD`, `C.MOVR`, …)
* Small immediate loads/stores (`C.LWI`, `C.SDI`, …)

[[isa-overview-hl]]
=== High-level (48-bit `HL.*`)

The catalog includes 48-bit forms (commonly `HL.*`) that pair a 16-bit prefix with a 32-bit main/postfix. These forms
are primarily used to extend immediate ranges (e.g. address materialization, larger offsets) while keeping the common
case compact.

[[isa-overview-vector]]
=== Vector (64-bit `V.*`)

The catalog includes 64-bit forms (commonly `V.*`) represented as a 32-bit prefix + 32-bit main/postfix. Detailed
vector semantics are outside the current bring-up scope unless specified by the golden sources (`spec/isa/golden/v0.3/`); the instruction reference
chapter enumerates the encodings present in the v0.2 catalog.

[[isa-overview-templates]]
=== Template blocks

Template-style forms such as `FENTRY` / `FRET.*` compact common prologue/epilogue sequences. In the bring-up model,
these are treated as **standalone blocks** that map to hardware macro execution (see <<templates>>).
