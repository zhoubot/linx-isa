[[preamble]]
== Preamble

This document is a *draft* ISA manual for the **Linx Instruction Set Architecture (Linx ISA)**.

The single source of truth for instruction encodings in this repo is:

* `isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.2.json` (machine-readable catalog built from `isa/golden/v0.2/`)
* `isa/generated/codecs/` (generated encode/decode tables derived from the JSON)

Where this manual and the machine-readable catalog disagree, treat the JSON as authoritative.

[[preamble-scope]]
=== Scope and maturity

Linx in this repository is under active bring-up. Some subsystems (toolchain, emulator, RTL) may not implement all
forms described by the catalog yet.

This manual focuses on:

* Architectural state and assembly conventions
* The block-structured control-flow model (`BSTART/BSTOP` and `SETC`)
* Template instructions (e.g. `FENTRY`, `FRET.*`) used by toolchains
* A complete instruction reference generated from the catalog
