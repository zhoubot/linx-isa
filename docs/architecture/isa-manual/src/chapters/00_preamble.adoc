== Preamble

This document is the canonical ISA manual for the **Linx Instruction Set Architecture (Linx ISA)**, version **v0.3**.

The single source of truth for instruction encodings in this repository is:

* `spec/isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.3.json` (machine-readable catalog built from `spec/isa/golden/v0.3/`)
* `spec/isa/generated/codecs/` (generated encode/decode tables derived from the JSON)

Where this manual and the machine-readable catalog disagree, the JSON catalog MUST be treated as authoritative.

NOTE: v0.3 unifies the previous v0.2 bring-up profile with v0.3 staged extensions. All architectural contracts are now defined in v0.3.

=== Brand mark

image::linxisa-logo.svg[align="center",width=140]

The LinxISA brand mark is a stylized **Lingxi** form that preserves the original silhouette while adding subtle
semiconductor-style detailing (routed traces, pads/vias) to preserve crisp readability in manual PDFs, web docs, and
toolchain-generated reports.

[[preamble-scope]]
=== Scope and maturity

This manual describes the **v0.3 Linx ISA** - a production-ready architecture that incorporates:

* The v0.2 bring-up baseline (privileged architecture, block-structured control flow, template blocks)
* v0.3 staged extensions (vector/tile operations, SIMD lane policy, MCALL modes)

The LinxISA project maintains alignment between:

* The machine-readable catalog (`spec/isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.3.json`)
* The LLVM backend (`llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/LinxISA/`)
* The QEMU emulator (`qemu/target/linx/`)
* This manual

This manual focuses on:

* Architectural state and assembly conventions
* The block-structured control-flow model (`BSTART/BSTOP` and `BARG`)
* Template instructions (e.g. `FENTRY`, `FRET.*`) used by toolchains
* A complete instruction reference generated from the catalog
* Privileged architecture (ACR, SSR, trap envelope)
* Vector/tile extensions (v0.3 staged)
