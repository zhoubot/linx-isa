== Changelog

This section records notable changes to the LinxISA catalog and to the associated manual/tooling in this repository.

[[changelog-branding-2026-02-14]]
=== Branding update — 2026-02-14

**Logo and identity**

* Added the official LinxISA SVG logo asset:
  - `docs/architecture/isa-manual/src/images/linxisa-logo.svg`
* Added logo usage in repository README and ISA manual preamble.
* Refined the mark by preserving the original silhouette and adding semiconductor-style technical detailing
  (routed traces, pads/vias) while keeping the **Lingxi** identity direction for ISA branding consistency.

[[changelog-v0-3-strict-26check-2026-02-12]]
=== v0.3 (strict 26-check cutover) — 2026-02-12

**Contract and gates**

* Added strict 26-check contract artifacts:
  - `docs/bringup/CHECK26_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/bringup/check26_contract.yaml`
  - `tools/bringup/check26_contract.py`
* Wired 26-check gate into regression.

**Current spec cutover**

* Switched default compiled catalog to `spec/isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.3.json`.
* Kept `spec/isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.3.json` as legacy reference.
* Updated regression/codegen generator paths to use strict v0.3 current catalog by default.

**Architecture alignment**

* Locked strict memory-model wording to TSO in v0.3 state + manual.
* Updated block ISA chapter for typed block-start canonical policy.
* Added vector bridge naming contract (`load.local`/`store.local`, `load.brg`/`store.brg`, `ri*`, `TA/TB/TO/TS`).
* Added explicit architectural wording for tile bounds (`512B..4KB`, 32 tiles, 128KB architectural cap).

[[changelog-v0-3-unified-2026-02-11]]
=== v0.3 (unified) — 2026-02-11

**Manual refactoring (this release)**

* Merged v0.2 and v0.3 profiles into a single v0.3 specification.
* Replaced all CARG terminology with BARG (Block Argument Register) across the manual.
* Added Block ISA interaction guidance to instruction groups (normative requirements).
* Added evidence citations (MAN-01 through MAN-07) throughout for traceability.
* Fixed style issues: removed weasel words, enforced RFC 2119 normative language.
* Updated TODO markers to reference Linux bring-up status.

**Canonical specification**

* Updated preamble to reference `spec/isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.3.json` as the single source of truth.
* The v0.3 profile now unifies the v0.2 bring-up baseline with v0.3 staged extensions.

[[changelog-v0-3-staged-2026-02-11]]
=== v0.3 (staged) — 2026-02-11

**Reconciliation and canonicalization**

* Added machine-checkable v0.3 reconciliation artifacts generated from raw sources:
  - `spec/isa/golden/v0.3/reconcile/reconcile_report.json`
  - `spec/isa/golden/v0.3/reconcile/reconcile_notes.md`
* Locked canonical output policy for v0.3 staged artifacts:
  - typed block starts (`BSTART.<type>`) only; no canonical `BSTART.PAR`,
  - `V.*` mnemonic family only in canonical v0.3 outputs,
  - legacy `.kill` spellings treated as non-canonical input forms.

**Spec/tooling**

* Added staged v0.3 compiled catalog path: `spec/isa/spec/v0.3/linxisa-v0.3.json`.
* Extended ISA generators/validators with `--profile {v0.2,v0.3}` defaults.
* Added v0.3 drift gate: `tools/isa/check_no_legacy_v03.py`.

**AI-extension staging**

* Staged consistent AI bring-up subset (SIMT-lane policy, typed tile/vector block headers, TMA channel baseline).
* Deferred unresolved raw contracts from canonical v0.3 outputs:
  - `MAMULBMX*` `group=2` semantics,
  - non-reconciled legacy 0.53 fragments.

[[changelog-v0-2-bringup-2026-02-09]]
=== v0.2 (bring-up) — 2026-02-09

**Privileged/exception model**

* Defined the v0.2 exception model contract:
  - TRAPNO encoding: `E[63]=async`, `ARGV[62]`, `CAUSE[47:24]`, `TRAPNUM[5:0]`.
  - Precise PC recording rules via `ECSTATE.BI` and `EBARG` (`BPC.CUR` always; `TPC` is the resume PC when `BI=1`).
  - `ACRC` triggers an immediate synchronous system-call trap and MUST be followed by an explicit `BSTOP/C.BSTOP`.
  - `ACRE` is the only architectural restore entry (return/restore behavior keyed by `RRA`).
* Removed legacy trap-save SSRs from the v0.2 contract: `EBPC/ETPC/EBPCN` MUST NOT be used by v0.2 software.
* Clarified bring-up behavior for floating-point exceptions: v0.2 does not deliver FP traps; FP operations only update
  sticky status (e.g., `FFLAGS`).

**System registers (SSRs)**

* Defined the v0.2 manager-ACR SSR map as a single machine-checkable source and generate the manual SSR tables from it.
* Added the v0.2 `EBARG` register group (trap/context snapshot + extended-context pointers).
* Added v0.2 debug SSR allocations (breakpoints/watchpoints).

**Templates**

* Added v0.2 template blocks `ESAVE` and `ERCOV` for saving/restoring extended local state.

[[changelog-v0-1-draft-2026-02-06]]
=== v0.1 (draft) — 2026-02-06

**ISA catalog / encodings**

* Corrected the `FENCE.D` assembly operand name to `pred_imm` (was `perd_imm` in the draft tables).

**Manual / generated reference**

* Defined `TPC` and `BPC` terminology for PC-relative formulas and exception capture.
* Expanded Block ISA documentation with block header descriptor guidance (`B.IOR/B.IOT/B.ATTR/B.HINT/...`).
* Expanded memory chapter with endianness guidance and fence/ordering overview.
* Improved informative pseudocode in the generated instruction descriptions for:
  - `B.DIM` (shows `LB0/LB1/LB2` behavior),
  - `B.*` descriptor families (named operations instead of generic metadata),
  - execution-control and privileged instructions (`ASSERT`, `EBREAK`, `FENCE.*`, `ACRE/ACRC`).
* Privileged architecture alignment (from golden sources under `spec/isa/golden/v0.3/`):
** Rewrote the system/privilege chapter to define the v0.1 ACR model (up to 16 rings in a tree rooted at ACR0),
   `ACR_ENTER`/`SERVICE_REQUEST` flows, and `ACRC` routing.
** Updated the curated SSR table (`system_registers_ssr.adoc`) to match the v0.1 draft system-register IDs and to
   document 12-bit vs 24-bit SSR ID encodings (`SSRGET` vs `HL.SSRGET`) (including `CYCLE = 0x0C00`).
** Renamed the block commit argument state from CARG to BARG across the manual to match the draft naming.
