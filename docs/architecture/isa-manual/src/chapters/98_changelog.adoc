[[changelog-v0-2-bringup-2026-02-09]]
=== v0.2 (bring-up) — 2026-02-09

**Privileged/exception model**

* Defined the v0.2 exception model contract:
  - TRAPNO encoding: `E[63]=async`, `ARGV[62]`, `CAUSE[47:24]`, `TRAPNUM[5:0]`.
  - Precise PC recording rules via `ECSTATE.BI` and `EBARG` (`BPC.CUR` always; `TPC` is the resume PC when `BI=1`).
  - `ACRC` triggers an immediate synchronous system-call trap and MUST be followed by an explicit `BSTOP/C.BSTOP`.
  - `ACRE` is the only architectural restore entry (return/restore behavior keyed by `RRA`).
* Removed legacy trap-save SSRs from the v0.2 contract: `EBPC/ETPC/EBPCN` MUST NOT be used by v0.2 software.
* Clarified bring-up behavior for floating-point exceptions: v0.2 does not deliver FP traps; FP operations only update
  sticky status (e.g., `FFLAGS`).

**System registers (SSRs)**

* Defined the v0.2 manager-ACR SSR map as a single machine-checkable source and generate the manual SSR tables from it.
* Added the v0.2 `EBARG` register group (trap/context snapshot + extended-context pointers).
* Added v0.2 debug SSR allocations (breakpoints/watchpoints).

**Templates**

* Added v0.2 template blocks `ESAVE` and `ERCOV` for saving/restoring extended local state.

[[changelog-v0-1-draft-2026-02-06]]
=== v0.1 (draft) — 2026-02-06

**ISA catalog / encodings**

* Corrected the `FENCE.D` assembly operand name to `pred_imm` (was `perd_imm` in the draft tables).

**Manual / generated reference**

* Defined `TPC` and `BPC` terminology for PC-relative formulas and exception capture.
* Expanded Block ISA documentation with block header descriptor guidance (`B.IOR/B.IOT/B.ATTR/B.HINT/...`).
* Expanded memory chapter with endianness guidance and fence/ordering overview.
* Improved informative pseudocode in the generated instruction descriptions for:
  - `B.DIM` (shows `LB0/LB1/LB2` behavior),
  - `B.*` descriptor families (named operations instead of generic metadata),
  - execution-control and privileged instructions (`ASSERT`, `EBREAK`, `FENCE.*`, `ACRE/ACRC`).
* Privileged architecture alignment (from golden sources under `isa/golden/v0.1/`):
** Rewrote the system/privilege chapter to define the v0.1 ACR model (up to 16 rings in a tree rooted at ACR0),
   `ACR_ENTER`/`SERVICE_REQUEST` flows, and `ACRC` routing.
** Updated the curated SSR table (`system_registers_ssr.adoc`) to match the v0.1 draft system-register IDs and to
   document 12-bit vs 24-bit SSR ID encodings (`SSRGET` vs `HL.SSRGET`) (including `CYCLE = 0x0C00`).
** Renamed the block commit argument state from CARG to BARG across the manual to match the draft naming.
