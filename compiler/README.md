# Compiler

The LinxISA compiler implementation is at ~/llvm-project

This directory will contain the LinxISA compiler components (e.g. LLVM backend, assembler integration, ABI/calling
convention, and tests).

All encode/decode and instruction definitions must reference `isa/spec/current/linxisa-v0.2.json`.

Canonical compiler bring-up plan and status: `compiler/COMPILER_PLAN.md`.
